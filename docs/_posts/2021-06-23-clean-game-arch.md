# Break-down of the components of a software architecture

First of all, let's break down the four different components of a software architecture:

1. **Data.** Immutable data. *Assets, configurations, game design.*
2. **State.** Mutable data, current configurations and current states. *This is what goes into the saved game or the online messages.*
3. **Control.** Reads data and state to perform transformations to the state. (This can also be considered data and state).
4. **Display.** Show the data and state, or the difference between states. *Images, sound, text, logs, controller vibration, etc.*

There are a few more parts to software happening outside the code space of a certain project: Third party libraries (even if they are our own), resources (personnel, time and money constraints), coding guidelines, working procedures and, the most important of them all, knowledge of the domain. And, for the sake of completion, let's say that our code base will also contain comments and bugs.

But jokes aside, that's it. There's nothing else you need to be aware of.

The main focus of this post will be to handle unnecessary complexity.

# Causes of unnecessary complexity (and how to avoid them)

What will create unnecessary complexity in your architecture is:
- Adding unnecesary data. Any single extra bit doubles the complexity, so be wary of everything you add.
- Mixing different sets of data more than necessary. This creates illogical dependencies that end up tangling in a web.

But this is all too abstract, so let's get down to business:
1. **Try to implement data and state with as basic the types as possible**. The ideal is to implement them fully with the basic types provided in the language. If the data and state are implemented with the most basic types available, it will be easier to modify or refactor both the information representation (data and state) and the operations (control and display). Most games tend to be arrays of ints, enumerations, and dctionaries with a string key. And then, arrays of these (entities, inventories, quest lists, maps).
2. **Rely on implicit information**. If you can infer a data point from other variables, there's no need to create a new variable. That variable is already there and therefore redundant. This is called duplicity. If the processing is costly, cache the result once calculated but make it obvious it is not a variable but an immutable inferred data point (read-only, hiding it behind a getter, records, etc).
3. **Keep the four different parts clearly separated between each other.** Mixing different code parts. Data and state, or state and control, or control and display.
4. **Separate based in the implementation, not on ontological entities.**  Mixing different object states with different control procedures. Indiscriminate implementation of OOP, trying to make everything generic, or mixing different code parts. Mixing diffferent programming parts because they feel ontologically related, forcing totally independent code together because in real life they are close. This is perhaps the most dangerous and widespread one. Equating the problem domain to both an object state and control operations, putting together variables and operations that donâ€™t rely on each other in any way. This one is erroneously sprung by an indiscriminate implementation of OOP.

Now, let's look some examples.

# Examples

## First: Use as basic types as possible
Every language has different basic types.

## Second: Rely on implicit information
The Player has its Position over a MapTile of the type Healing. There's no need to save this in a variable inside Player or Map. Checking the Player.Position inside the array Map.MapTiles is enough. Implemented like this, the only variable that has to change is Player.Position, and there's no need to keep refreshing Player.TypeOfTile, or Map.PlayerOverTileOfType. These two, if necessary, will be getters that perform the calculations.

## Third: Know and respect the boundaries

## Fourth: Difference between implementation and ontological entities
Where should the position of the Player be? In Map, or in Player? Perhaps in a new and different location, that will contain all the entity positions?
